### Project Task
Sequence Acquisition: Retrieved the TNF gene sequence from NCBI and visualized it using BioEdit.
Amino Acid Translation: Translated the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.
Open Reading Frame (ORF) Analysis: Identified ORFs within the gene sequence using BioEdit.
Nucleotide Composition Analysis: Analyzed nucleotide frequencies and GC content.
Transcription Factor Binding Sites Identification: Identified potential binding sites using PROMO.
Functional Motif Discovery: Detected motifs using MEME Suite.
Coding/Non-Coding Region Prediction: Predicted regions using GENSCAN.
File Format Conversion: Converted sequence files between FASTA and PHYLIP formats.
